# Security Review - iMessage Advanced Insights MCP Server

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security review has been conducted on the iMessage Advanced Insights MCP Server. The codebase demonstrates strong security practices with no critical vulnerabilities identified.

## Security Strengths

### 1. Database Security
- ✅ **Read-only mode enforced**: All database connections use `PRAGMA query_only = ON`
- ✅ **Parameterized queries**: All SQL queries use proper parameter binding
- ✅ **No SQL injection risks**: No string concatenation or formatting in queries
- ✅ **Path validation**: Database paths are properly expanded and validated

### 2. Privacy Protection
- ✅ **Consent-based access**: All tools check consent before execution
- ✅ **Contact hashing**: SHA-256 hashing of contact identifiers by default
- ✅ **Aggressive redaction**: PII patterns are detected and removed
- ✅ **No network calls**: All processing is local-only

### 3. Code Security
- ✅ **No dangerous functions**: No use of eval(), exec(), subprocess, os.system()
- ✅ **No hardcoded secrets**: No passwords, API keys, or tokens in code
- ✅ **Type safety**: Pydantic models for input validation
- ✅ **Error handling**: Consistent error responses without leaking sensitive info

### 4. Access Control
- ✅ **Time-limited consent**: Consent expires after specified duration
- ✅ **Explicit consent required**: No implicit data access
- ✅ **Revocation support**: Users can immediately revoke access

## Potential Security Considerations

### 1. File System Access
- The server reads from the macOS Messages database at a fixed location
- Consider adding path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Recommendation: Whitelist allowed database paths

### 2. Resource Limits
- No explicit limits on query result sizes
- Large databases could cause memory issues
- Recommendation: Add pagination and result limits

### 3. Logging
- Ensure logs don't contain sensitive message content
- Current implementation appears safe but needs monitoring

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Read-only database access
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of privacy protection
3. **Secure by Default**: Redaction and hashing enabled by default
4. **Fail Secure**: Errors don't expose sensitive information
5. **Input Validation**: Pydantic models validate all inputs

## Recommendations

1. **Add rate limiting**: Prevent resource exhaustion
2. **Implement audit logging**: Track access patterns
3. **Add database path whitelist**: Restrict accessible paths
4. **Set query timeouts**: Prevent long-running queries
5. **Regular security updates**: Keep dependencies updated

## Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR**: Consent management and data minimization
- **CCPA**: User control over personal data
- **HIPAA**: Not applicable (not healthcare data)

## Conclusion

The iMessage Advanced Insights MCP Server demonstrates strong security practices appropriate for handling sensitive communication data. The privacy-first design, combined with robust access controls and secure coding practices, provides a solid security foundation.

No critical security vulnerabilities were identified during this review. The recommendations above would further strengthen the security posture but are not required for initial release.
