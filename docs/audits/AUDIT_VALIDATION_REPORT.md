# Audit Validation Report - iMessage MCP Server

## Executive Summary

After thorough review of the MCP server implementation, several critical issues were identified that prevent the server from functioning correctly with Claude Desktop.

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Incorrect MCP SDK Usage** ❌
   - Import statements use non-existent `mcp` module structure
   - Should use `mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP` instead of `mcp.Server`
   - Tool registration pattern is incorrect

2. **Missing Consent Integration** ❌
   - Consent manager exists but isn't integrated with MCP tools
   - Tools don't check consent before execution
   - No consent enforcement decorator applied

3. **Import Path Issues** ❌
   - Relative imports assume wrong package structure
   - Missing __init__.py files in some directories
   - Circular import potential

## Detailed Findings

### 1. MCP Protocol Implementation

**Current Code (WRONG):**
```python
from mcp import Server, NotificationOptions
from mcp.server.models import InitializationOptions
from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server

server = Server("imessage-insights")
```

**Should Be:**
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("imessage-insights")

# Run with stdio
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport='stdio')
```

### 2. Tool Registration Pattern

**Current Code (WRONG):**
```python
@server.tool()
async def imsg_health_check(arguments: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    ...
```

**Should Be:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
async def imsg_health_check(
    db_path: str = "~/Library/Messages/chat.db"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Validate DB access, schema presence, index hints, and read-only mode."""
    # FastMCP handles argument parsing automatically
    ...
```

### 3. Missing Components

#### Consent Enforcement
The consent manager exists but isn't used. Need to:
1. Import consent manager in tools
2. Check consent before tool execution
3. Handle consent errors properly

#### Proper Error Handling
Tools return raw error dicts instead of using MCP error patterns.

### 4. Configuration Issues

- Environment variables not properly documented
- Config loading doesn't handle missing files gracefully
- Session salt generation happens too early

### 5. Privacy Implementation Gaps

✅ **Working:**
- BLAKE2b hashing implementation exists
- PII redaction functions defined
- Preview caps logic present

❌ **Not Working:**
- Not applied by default in tools
- Consent not checked before access
- Audit logging not implemented

## Required Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix MCP Implementation

1. **Rewrite main.py to use FastMCP**
2. **Update all tool files to use correct decorators**
3. **Fix import statements throughout**

### Priority 2: Integrate Consent

1. **Add consent checking to all tools**
2. **Implement consent decorator**
3. **Add audit logging**

### Priority 3: Complete Missing Features

1. **Add proper error handling**
2. **Implement streaming for large results**
3. **Add progress reporting for long operations**

## Validation Checklist

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MCP Protocol | ❌ | Wrong SDK usage |
| Tool Registration | ❌ | Incorrect pattern |
| Consent Management | ⚠️ | Exists but not integrated |
| Privacy (Hashing) | ✅ | Implemented correctly |
| Privacy (Redaction) | ✅ | Functions exist |
| Privacy (Default On) | ❌ | Not enforced |
| Database Read-Only | ✅ | Properly implemented |
| Preview Caps | ✅ | Logic exists |
| Error Handling | ❌ | Inconsistent |
| Documentation | ✅ | Comprehensive |

## Performance Concerns

- No connection pooling for SQLite
- No query result caching
- Memory monitoring not integrated
- No progress reporting for long operations

## Security Review

✅ **Good:**
- Read-only database connections
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Proper parameter binding

❌ **Needs Work:**
- Consent not enforced
- No rate limiting
- Audit logs not persisted

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Fix MCP Implementation**
   - Rewrite using FastMCP
   - Test with Claude Desktop
   - Verify tool discovery works

2. **Integrate Consent System**
   - Add consent decorator
   - Check consent in each tool
   - Implement audit logging

3. **Apply Privacy Defaults**
   - Ensure redaction is on by default
   - Hash all contact IDs
   - Enforce preview caps

### Follow-up Actions (Week 2)

1. **Add Tests**
   - Unit tests for each tool
   - Integration tests with mock DB
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Optimize Performance**
   - Add connection pooling
   - Implement result caching
   - Add progress reporting

## Conclusion

The implementation has good foundational components (privacy functions, database layer, documentation) but critical issues with the MCP protocol implementation prevent it from working with Claude Desktop. The fixes are straightforward but require significant refactoring of the tool registration pattern.

Estimated effort to fix all issues: 2-3 days of focused development.
