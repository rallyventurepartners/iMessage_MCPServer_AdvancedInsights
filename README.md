## üí° Use Cases & Example Prompts

### Relationship Analysis
```
You: "Analyze my communication patterns with Sarah over the past 6 months"

Claude: I'll analyze your communication with Sarah. Let me check the patterns...

Based on 847 messages exchanged:
- Response time improved 45% (now averaging 12 minutes)
- Conversation depth increased with longer messages (+28%)
- Peak communication shifted from evenings to lunch hours
- Sentiment trending positive (+0.15 over 6 months)
- You initiate 58% of conversations (well balanced)
```

### Optimal Contact Timing
```
You: "When's the best time to reach John about work matters?"

Claude: Based on John's response patterns:
- **Best times**: Tue-Thu 10-11 AM (87% response rate within 30min)
- **Good times**: Mon/Fri 2-3 PM (72% response rate)
- **Avoid**: Evenings and weekends (<30% response rate)
```

### Communication Health Check
```
You: "How healthy are my closest relationships based on messaging patterns?"

Claude: Analyzing your top 5 contacts by message volume...

‚úÖ Strong indicators:
- Balanced conversation ratios (45-55% initiation)
- Consistent communication (no gaps >7 days)
- Positive sentiment trends in 4/5 relationships

‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to consider:
- Contact "hash:a3f2..." showing decreased frequency (-40%)
- Consider reaching out to reconnect
```

### Network Intelligence
```
You: "Who are the key connectors in my social network?"

Claude: Based on group chat analysis:

Key connectors (bridge multiple groups):
1. hash:b7c9... - Present in 8 different groups
2. hash:f2a1... - Connects work and personal circles
3. hash:d4e8... - Central to family communications
```

### Anomaly Detection
```
You: "Have there been any unusual communication patterns recently?"

Claude: Detected 3 anomalies in the past 30 days:

1. Unusual silence with hash:c8d2... (normally daily contact)
2. Spike in late-night messages (2-4 AM) last week
3. New contact with sudden high volume (possible spam/scam)
```

### Life Event Detection
```
You: "Can you identify any major life events from my conversation patterns?"

Claude: Potential life events detected:

- Mid-September: Surge in "congratulations" messages (possible achievement)
- October: Travel-related keywords spike (trip/vacation?)
- November: Increased family communication (+60%)
```

### Long-Term Analytics with Visualizations
```
You: "Show me my communication patterns with Sarah over the past 3 years with charts"

Claude: I'll analyze your 3-year communication history with Sarah and generate visualizations.

Based on 36 months of data (8,247 messages):

üìä Key Insights:
- Overall trend: Increasing (+2.3 messages/month average growth)
- Current average: 18.5 messages/day (up from 12.1 three years ago)
- Communication balance: Very healthy (52% you, 48% Sarah)
- Peak activity: Weekdays 7-9 PM, minimal on Sunday mornings

üìà Visualizations generated:
1. **Time Series Chart**: Shows steady growth with seasonal dips in August
2. **Communication Heatmap**: Most active Tue-Thu evenings
3. **Balance Chart**: Consistently balanced throughout the period

The relationship shows strong, sustained growth with excellent reciprocity.
```

### Multi-Contact Comparison
```
You: "Compare my messaging patterns across my top 5 contacts over 6 months"

Claude: Analyzing communication patterns across your top 5 contacts...

üìä Comparative Analysis (6 months):
1. Sarah: 3,421 messages (19.0/day) - Most active, very balanced
2. Work Team: 2,156 messages (11.9/day) - Weekday focused
3. Mom: 1,832 messages (10.2/day) - Evening calls trigger text follow-ups
4. John: 987 messages (5.5/day) - Declining trend (-30%)
5. College Group: 743 messages (4.1/day) - Burst pattern around events

Key Observations:
- Sarah represents 35% of your total messaging
- Work communications drop 95% on weekends
- Consider reaching out to John (declining engagement)

[Visualization shows overlaid time series for all 5 contacts]

| 1-10 GB | < 100ms | < 500ms | < 1s | < 250 MB |
| 10-50 GB | < 200ms | < 1s | < 2s | < 500 MB |
| 50+ GB | Use sharding | < 2s | < 5s | < 1 GB |

**Performance Features:**
- Connection pooling with automatic retry
- Query result caching (5 min TTL)
- Streaming processing for large datasets
- Automatic database sharding for 20GB+ databases
- Memory monitoring with automatic limits

## üöß Limitations & Troubleshooting

### Known Limitations
- **macOS only** (requires access to iMessage SQLite database)
- **Read-only access** (cannot send or modify messages)
- **iCloud Messages**: Limited local availability (use cloud-aware tools)
- **Group chats**: Some metadata may be incomplete
- **Attachments**: Not analyzed (privacy by design)

### Common Issues

#### "Database not found" Error
```bash
# Verify database exists
ls -la ~/Library/Messages/chat.db

# Check Full Disk Access is granted
# System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Full Disk Access
```

#### "99% messages in iCloud"
```bash
# Check cloud status
python -m imessage_mcp_server.tools.cloud_aware --status

# Force download from iCloud
brctl download ~/Library/Messages/
```

#### "No active consent"
Always request consent first in Claude:
```
"I need to analyze my messages, please request consent"
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Run optimization
python scripts/add_performance_indexes.py

# Enable sharding for large databases
python scripts/shard_large_database.py --db chat.db
```
